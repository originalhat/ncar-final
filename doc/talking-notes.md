### slide 1

+ hello, thanks for coming 
+ talking about: 
	- the field-catalog monitoring application that I worked over this summer

+ before diving in, I'll give a quick overview of the presentation...

### slide 2

+ for part 1 I'll be talking briefly about myself, that means:
	- who am I, where did I come from, and what's my background
+ the next part, which is the majority of the presentation will focus on the project specifics
+ this is broken down into several sub-steps
	- first: we'll quickly go over the nature of the problem that's attempting to be addressed
	- secondly: we'll look at the approach
		+ that is we'll talk about how the problem is going to be addressed
	- and the third point will be a short demo with examples of implemented functionality
		- i've opted to take the less "exciting" route and provide you all with screenshots displaying program functionality
	- I'll quickly talk about future features that could be integrated in the near future
	- finally, the presentation will end with a "big picture" summary of what went well, what could have gone better
	- after this, there should be some time for questions

+ with that out of the way lets dive into the core of the presentation

### slide 3

+ so again, very quickly, I'll be giving some background about myself

### slide 4

+ perhaps most pertinently is where the inter goes to school, for me that's Metro State or Metropolitan State University Denver
	- I'm double majoring in computer science and mathematics and will be entering my senior semester this fall
+ my previous experience with coding has been primarily focused on academic heavy languages such as Java, C, C++ and other object-intesive studies
+ as for "real world" experience, NCAR was my first glimpse at real business and software development practices - and I'm glad to say it was a fantastic experience at that


------

### the approach

+ we don't care what the ingest errors are, but rather IF these ingest errors are occuring. The overal goal is to detect ingest errors.
+ in a nutshell, this program's allow for a configurable interface with an automated checks and notification system for incoming data from field projects

### thanks

+ erik johnson and everyone in CTM
+ whitney robinson for her help with all the internships "business" side of things
+ nick potts and chris burghart for the awesome building tours and weekly meetings
+ and the great other SUPER interns I was fortunate to hang with over the summer - two of which make fantastic roomates btw.
